- Has no console errors or warnings
- Is fully accessible (WCAG AA)
- Is mobile responsive on all pages
- Deploys successfully to matheusmortatti.com
- Has proper meta tags and SEO

- HTTPS works

## What We're NOT Doing

- Not implementing analytics (can add later)
- Not adding A/B testing
- Not implementing advanced SEO (just basics)
- Not setting up monitoring/alerting
- Not creating backup strategies beyond git

## Implementation Approach

Work through systematic testing: automated checks first (build, types, accessibility), then manual testing (browsers, devices, functionality), then performance optimization, then deployment verification.

## Phase 1: Automated Quality Checks

### Overview
Run all automated checks to catch errors and issues.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Run TypeScript Check
**Command**:
```bash
npm run astro check
```

Fix any TypeScript errors found.

#### 2. Verify Build Success
**Command**:
```bash
npm run build
```

Ensure build completes without errors or warnings.

#### 3. Check for Console Errors
**Command**:
```bash
npm run preview
```

Visit all pages and check browser console for errors.

#### 4. Validate HTML
**Tool**: Use https://validator.w3.org/ or similar

- Visit each page
- Validate HTML structure
- Fix any validation errors

#### 5. Check for Broken Links
**Command** (optional tool):
```bash
# Install if needed
npm install -D broken-link-checker

# Run link checker
npx blc http://localhost:4321 -ro
```

Fix any broken links found.

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] `npm run astro check` passes with no errors
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds with no warnings
