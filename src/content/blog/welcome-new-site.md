Welcome to the redesigned matheusmortatti.com!

This site has been rebuilt from the ground up using modern web technologies:

- **Astro** for fast, content-focused static site generation
- **Catppuccin** color theme for a cozy aesthetic
- Clean, minimal design focused on readability

## What's Here

You'll find my blog posts, both old and new, as well as information about my work and projects.

## What's Next

I plan to write more regularly about:
- Game development
- Programming
- Tools and workflows
- Conference experiences

Stay tuned!
